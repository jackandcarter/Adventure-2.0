\f0\fs24 \cf0 # AdventureBot 2.0 \'96 Project Overview\
\
## Vision\
\
AdventureBot 2.0 is a **co-op, top-down action RPG** inspired by *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past* (SNES era). It features modern visuals and systems, with:\
\
- Up to **6 players** in a dungeon session.\
- A **main lobby / hub** area where logged-in users can:\
  - Hang out and chat in real time.\
  - Form parties.\
  - Start new **randomly generated dungeon runs**.\
- Procedural dungeons using reusable **room prefabs** with doors, keys, traps, and bosses.\
- Deep RPG systems:\
  - Classes and abilities\
  - Limit break / trance meter\
  - Status effects, buffs, debuffs\
  - DoT, HoT, resurrection, death handling\
  - Attack speed, cast time, evasion, crit\
  - Elemental system (elements, weaknesses, resistances, affinities)\
\
The original AdventureBot for Discord was turn-based with text output and procedural runs. Here we are **keeping that systemic depth**, but moving to **real-time, top-down action** with shared online play and production-quality architecture.\
\
## Tech Stack\
\
- **Client:** Unity 6.2, C#, 2D top-down.\
- **Server:** .NET 8 console app (C#) running on Ubuntu.\
- **Database:** MariaDB (existing on VPS).\
- **Networking:** JSON messages over TCP or WebSocket (authoritative server).\
\
## Architecture Overview\
\
### Unity Client\
\
Responsibilities:\
\
- Input handling, camera, movement for local player.\
- Rendering:\
  - Tiles, sprites, animations.\
  - UI: health/mana/trance, ability bar, mini-map, chat, etc.\
- Client-side prediction (if used) and smoothing.\
- Scene management (Bootstrap \uc0\u8594  MainMenu \u8594  Lobby \u8594  Dungeon).\
- No authoritative decisions; all final game state comes from server.\
\
### Game Server\
\
Responsibilities:\
\
- Player connections & sessions.\
- Authentication (login, account association).\
- Lobby/hub:\
  - List of online players.\
  - Party creation/join/leave.\
  - Chat channels (lobby, party, dungeon).\
- Dungeon instance management:\
  - Create instance from seed and theme.\
  - Maintain room graph and states.\
  - Track players inside each instance.\
- Simulation:\
  - Movement validation.\
  - Hit detection.\
  - Combat resolution.\
  - Status effects, DoTs, HoTs, buffs/debuffs.\
  - Limit break / trance meter.\
- Persistence:\
  - Accounts, characters\
  - Inventory and equipment\
  - Ability unlocks\
  - Dungeon run history and rewards\
\
### Database (MariaDB)\
\
- Single source of persistent truth for:\
  - Accounts & characters.\
  - Items, inventory, equipment.\
  - Ability unlocks and progression.\
  - Dungeon runs and outcomes.\
- Some data may be **static definitions** (items, abilities) stored in JSON/ScriptableObjects client-side and/or mirrored in DB for analytics and future features.\
\
## Major Systems\
\
1. **Networking & Sessions**\
   - Low-level network listener, encoding/decoding JSON messages.\
   - Session tracking, auth, heartbeats/timeouts.\
\
2. **Lobby & Matchmaking**\
   - Players join lobby after login.\
   - Chat in lobby.\
   - Create/join parties.\
   - Start dungeon instance for a party.\
\
3. **Dungeon Generation & Instances**\
   - Seed and theme based.\
   - Graph of room instances using predefined room templates.\
   - Doors (open/locked), keys, triggers, boss rooms.\
   - Instance lifecycle: create \uc0\u8594  active \u8594  clear/wipe/abort \u8594  teardown.\
\
4. **Character System & Progression**\
   - Classes, base stats, growth.\
   - Leveling, XP, unlocked abilities.\
   - Equipment and inventory.\
\
5. **Combat System (Real-time)**\
   - Player/enemy movement.\
   - Abilities (cast time, cooldown, cost).\
   - Status effects (buffs/debuffs).\
   - Damage, healing, crits, evasion.\
   - Trance/limit break.\
\
6. **Element System**\
   - Elements (e.g. Fire, Ice, Lightning, Earth, Light, Dark).\
   - Elemental affinities, resistances, weaknesses.\
   - Damage multipliers.\
\
7. **Editor Tools**\
   - ScriptableObjects for:\
     - Classes\
     - Abilities\
     - Status effects\
     - Elements\
     - Enemies\
     - Loot tables\
     - Room templates\
     - Dungeon themes\
   - Custom editor windows:\
     - Content browser\
     - Room template editor\
     - Dungeon theme editor\
   - Validation tools: e.g. check for broken references, invalid identifiers.\
\
8. **UI & UX**\
   - All main UI built in Unity editor with Canvas system.\
   - Scripts only drive pre-existing UI:\
     - Binding, toggling, populating lists using element prefabs.\
     - No full runtime layout generation.\
\
## Implementation Phases\
\
See `07_TASKS_FOR_CODEX.md` for explicit tasks.\
\
High-level phases:\
\
1. Server skeleton + DB.\
2. Unity client core (Bootstrap, scenes, base networking).\
3. Lobby + party + chat.\
4. Dungeon instances + basic combat.\
5. RPG systems & content tools.\
6. Polishing, anti-cheat, and performance hardening.\
